        When I was growing up, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was a constant in my world. I felt like I was too old for puppets and <em>make believe</em>, but I was young enough to be enamored with some of the things he would show his viewers, like a crayon
        factory.
        <br>
        <br> As I grew older, I came to appreciate the subtle way he helped me keep from walking down a different path. I've come to understand why Fred was the way he was, and how he grew up. Fred Rogers' neighborhood is <em>my</em> neighborhood. And
        it's <em>your</em> neighborhood, too.
